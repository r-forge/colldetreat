\title{Condition Number with and without intercept}
\description{This function returns the Condition Number (CN) of the independent variables of a multiple linear model considering the intercept and without considering it. It also returns the increase produced by going from not taking into account the intercept to having it.
}
\usage{CNs(X)}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{A numeric design matrix that should contain more than one regressor (intercept included).}
}
 
\value{
  \item{CN1}{Condition Number without intercept.}
  \item{CN2}{Condition Number with intercept.}
  \item{increment}{Increase (in percentage) in the CN from CN1 to CN2.}
