\title{Stewart's index}
\description{The function returns the index of Stewart of the independent variables in the multiple linear regession model.}
\usage{ki(X, dummy = F, pos = NULL)}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{A numeric design matrix that should contain more than one regressor (intercept included).}
  \item{dummy}{A logical value that indicates if there are dummy variables in the design matrix \code{X}. By default \code{dummy=F}.}
  \item{pos}{A numeric vector that indicates the position of the dummy variables, if these exist, in the design matrix \code{X}. By default \code{pos=NULL}.}
}
\details{
  The index of Stewart allows to detect the near essential and non-essential multicollinearity existing in a multiple linear regression model. In addition, due to its relation with the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), it allows to calculate the proportion of essential and non-essential multicollinearity  in each independent variable (intercept excluded). The Stewart's index for the intercept indicates the degree of non-essential multicollinearity existing in the model.
   
  The relation of the the VIF with the index of Stewart implies that it should not be calculated for non-quantitative variables.

\value{

  \item{porc1}{Proportion of essential multicollinearity in the i-th independent variable (without intercept).}
  \item{porc2}{Proportion of non-essential multicollinearity in the i-th independent variable (without intercept).}
