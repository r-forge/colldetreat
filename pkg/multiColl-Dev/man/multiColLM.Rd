\title{All detection measures}
\description{
The functions collects all the measure to detect near worrying multicollinearity existing in the package \code{multiCol}. In adddition, it provides the estimations by ordinary least squares (OLS) of the multiple linear regession model and the variations in the estimations of the coefficients as a consequence of changes in the observed data.
}
\usage{
multiColLM(y, X, dummy = F, pos1 = NULL, n, mu, dv, tol = 0.01, pos2 = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{Observations of the dependent variable of the model.}
  \item{X}{Observations of the independent variables of the model (intercept included).}
  \item{dummy}{A logical value that indicates if there are dummy variables in the design matrix \code{X}. By default \code{dummy=F}.}
  \item{pos1}{A numeric vector that indicates the position of the dummy variables, if these exist, in the design matrix \code{X}. By default \code{pos=NULL}.}
  \item{n}{Number of times that the perturbation is performed.}
  \item{mu}{Any real number.}
  \item{dv}{Any real positive number.}
  \item{tol}{A value between 0 and 1. By default \code{tol=0.01}.}
  \item{pos2}{A numeric vector that indicates the position of the independent variables to disturb once you eliminate in \code{data} the dependent variable and the intercept. By default \code{pos=NULL}.}

\value{
  The estimation by OLS of the linear regression model. 
  
  Percentiles 2.5 and 97.5 of the proportion of the variations in the estimations of the coefficients obtained from a perturbation of \code{tol}\% in the quantitative variables of \code{X}.
  
  If X contains two independent variables (intercept included) see \code{SLM} function. 
  
  If X contains more than two independent variables (intercept included):

    \item{Prop}{Proportion of ones in the dummy variables.}
    \item{R}{Matrix correlation of the quantitative variables in \code{X}.}
    \item{detR}{Determinant of the matrix correlation of the quantitative variables in \code{X}.}
    \item{VIF}{Variance Inflation Factors of the quantitative variables in \code{X}.}
    \item{CN}{Condition Number of \code{X}.}
    \item{ki}{Stewart's index of the quantitative variables in \code{X}.}
