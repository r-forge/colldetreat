\title{Condition Number}
\description{This function returns the Condition Number (CN) of the independent variables in a multiple linear regression.}
\usage{CN(X)}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{A numeric design matrix that should contain more than one regressor (intercept included).}
}
\details{
  Due to the CN takes into account the intercept, it allows to detect not only the essential but also the non-essential collinearity. It also allows to consider non-quantitative independent variables. 
  
  Its calculation is obtained from the function \code{lu}, contrary to the function \code{kappa}.
}
\value{The condition number of a matrix, that is, the maximum condition index.}
