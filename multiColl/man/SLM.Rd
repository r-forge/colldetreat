\title{Simple linear regression model and multicollinearity}
\description{The function analyzes the presence of near worrying multicollinearity in the Simple Linear Model (SLM).}
\usage{SLM(X, dummy = F)}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{A numeric design matrix that should contain two independent variables (intercept included).}
  \item{dummy}{A logical value that indicates if there are dummy variables in the design matrix \code{X}. By default \code{dummy=F}.}
}
\details{
 The analysis of the presence of near worrying multicolllinearity in the SLM has been systematically ignored in some existing statistical softwares.  However, it is possible to find worrying non essential multicollinearity in the SLM. In this case, the linear relation will be given by a second variable of \code{X} with very little variablity. For this reason, the coeficient of variation is calculated when the variable is quantitative and the proportion of ones if the variable is non-quantitative.

\value{
  If \code{dummy=T}:
    \item{Prop}{Proportion of ones in the dummy variable.}
    \item{CN}{Condition Number of \code{X}.}
  If \code{dummy=F}:
    \item{CV}{Coeficient of variation of the second variable in \code{X}.}
    \item{VIF}{Variance Inflation Factor.}
    \item{CN}{Condition Number of \code{X}.}
    \item{ki}{Stewart's index of \code{X}.}
